SortedSet
-------------

Implementation of Immutable Sorted Set collection.

You can get it by downloading it directly or by typing:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install SortedSet

After it is installed you can start it by simply typing in your terminal:

.. code:: bash

    $ SortedSet(['list_of_integer_data'])

For example

.. code:: bash

    $ SortedSet([1, 2, 5, 3, 3, 1])

Would return the following

.. code:: bash

    $ {1, 2, 3, 5}
